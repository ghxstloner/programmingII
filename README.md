# Programming II - Homework Repository

## Description

Welcome to the **Programming II - Homework Repository**! This repository contains all the programming assignments from the **Programming II** course. Each assignment focuses on various programming concepts and techniques, providing practical implementations to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming, exception handling, string manipulation, data structures, algorithms, and more.

Feel free to explore the code to see how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, where each folder corresponds to a specific homework or assignment. Inside each folder, you will find:

-   **Source Code**: The main Java files (.java) containing the solution to the assignment.

-   **Assignment Instructions**: In some cases, there might be a `.pdf` or `.md` file containing the instructions or problem statement for the assignment.
## Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
-   A code editor such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **VS Code**
-   Basic understanding of Java programming and object-oriented principles

## Contributions

Since this repository contains personal homework assignments, I am not accepting contributions at the moment. However, if you have suggestions or spot an issue, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
